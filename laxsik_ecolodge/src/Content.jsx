          <h3>At the doorstep of Sapa nature</h3>
          <p>
            Acenturies ago in Sa Pa appeared a mysterious tribe; they built
            their houses on the high mountains where the terrain is dangerous
            and turned those places into arable land of their tribe. Day after
            day, they became the largest tribe in Sapa. Al the scenes of that
            beautiful painting helped us to conceptualize Lasik Ecolodge
            following the original of an early 20th-century H'Mong village right
            in the heart of Muong Hoa Valley.
